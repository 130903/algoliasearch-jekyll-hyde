Hey, we are thrilled to announce our nomination among the [Seedcamp Paris
finalists](http://www.rudebaguette.com/2012/11/30/here-are-the-20-startups-
selected-for-seedcamp-paris/)! The event will take place next week on Monday,
just before [LeWeb 2012](http://paris.leweb.co/) (by the way we'll be there,
feel free to ping us if you'd like to meet).

From what we learned from all over the place, the day's mentorship alone is
worth it. We're now fully committed to the event preparation! I'll try to
write a followup post with our impressions.

advice](http://blog.algolia.com/seedcamp-tips-and-advice-from-a-finalist/)
