We recently reached a new milestone towards the release of our Search as a
Service offer. We're now proud to offer 10 API clients, covering all major
languages.

Ease of use was a major focus during development. We began by offering a
complete and easy-to-integrate [REST API](http://docs.algoliav1.apiary.io/).
Providing API clients was a logical way to improve ease of use. You can now
quick start and test the engine with your data in a couple of minutes, with no
prior configuration whatsoever. Each API Client is released under the MIT
License and comes with a quick start and complete documentation:

  * [Javascript client](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-js)
  * [Ruby client](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-ruby)
  * [Python client](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-python)
  * [PHP client](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-php)
  * [iOS and OS X client](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-objc)
  * [Android client](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-android)
  * [Java client](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-java)
  * [C# client for Windows, Windows Phone and Silverlight](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-csharp)
  * [Node.js client](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-node)
  * [Command line client for linux/mac](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-cmd)

This variety of languages and platforms reveals the diversity of our beta
testers:

  * Customer size: from a small startup developing their MVP, to a big social network searching in their 130M+ users.
  * Volume: from a few queries to tens of millions per day. 
  * Technical environments: mobile, desktop, and web apps.
