[Start In Paris](http://www.startinparis.com/) is a monthly event where 5
startups have the opportunity to pitch their service to the Paris startup
community. After a first selection and then a public vote, we were selected as
one of 5 finalists of the #22 edition that took place yesterday, January the
28th!

Algolia has greatly evolved over the last few months, so it was an excellent
occasion for us to test a new pitch! And the response has truly exceeded our
expectations. After a 5 minute pitch we received a rush of questions,
displaying interest and insight from the 400-strong audience!

While we were the only tech startup to pitch to an audience including only a
few developers, we ranked second in votes, just behind [Kitchen
Trotter](http://www.kitchentrotter.com/), our fellow Seedcamp finalist from
last December. Congrat to them, they were truly excellent!
