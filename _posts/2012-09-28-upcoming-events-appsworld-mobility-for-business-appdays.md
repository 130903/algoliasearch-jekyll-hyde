With the summer behind us, the period is pretty active. It's really difficult
to attend all the great events, big and small, organized out there. After
[Mobile Monday](http://www.mobilemondayfrance.org/),
[Failcon](http://france.thefailcon.com/) and the first meeting of
[Appsterdam](http://appsterdam.rs/) Paris this week, here are the major mobile
app conferences we're attending in the next few weeks!

  * [Appsworld](http://www.apps-world.net/europe/), the 2nd and 3rd of October in London. It's a major event attended by lot of mobile industry professionals. There are expecting up to 5000 participants!
  * [Mobility for business](http://www.mobility-for-business.com/), the 11th and 12th of October in Paris. A big event too, they are expecting about 3000 attendees!
  * [Appdays](http://appdays.fr/), the 9th of November in Paris. A more human sized event (200 participants) and definitely a place to be!

If you happen to participate to one of these, get in touch for some passionate
discussion around mobile apps development!
